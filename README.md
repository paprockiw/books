# books
I have a lot of books in PDF format. I want to be able to search through all of them for specific information by key word or phrase, but it's inefficient to open each document and perform a search one by one. This project aims to let me keep my PDFs in a datastore that will also store each page as text, which I can use to make it searchable.
